# ihwPaper

This is a package which reproduces all IHW paper figures (as well as some additional figures for presentations etc.).

You can install it as follows:

```{r}
library("devtools")
# install IHW
install_github("vladchimescu/lpsymphony", subdir="lpsymphony")
install_github("nignatiadis/IHW")
# install FDRreg, version on CRAN is outdated
install_github(repo= "jgscott/FDRreg", subdir="R_pkg/", ref = "a63cebae6faecb1fb0ebee634195296f39faa11b")
# Bioconductor prerequisites
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite(c("genefilter","DESeq2","qvalue","Biobase","BiocParallel","airway","pasilla"))
# finally install this package
install_github("nignatiadis/ihwPaper")
```

Afterwards you can view the pre-built vignettes or rebuild them yourself.

Notice that the vignettes load binary .Rds files which are stored in inst/real_data_examples/result_files 
and inst/simulations_benchmarks/result_files. These have been generated by longer lasting jobs, the code for 
which can be found in inst/real_data_examples and inst/simulation_benchmarks.
